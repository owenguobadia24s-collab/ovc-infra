**Status:** IMPLEMENTED — aligns with `scripts/path1/run_trajectory_families.py` discovery logic.

**Purpose:** Locate the canonical state-plane trajectory for a given `(symbol, date_ny)` when generating trajectory-family fingerprints.

Selection logic is defined in `PATH1_EXECUTION_MODEL.md` (Trajectory Family Selection section).
