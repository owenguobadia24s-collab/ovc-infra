# Study Results

> ⚠️ **NON-CANONICAL** — This study is downstream research only.  
> **NO FEEDBACK INTO CANONICAL** — Findings do not alter Option B/C definitions.

## Critical Disclaimer

> **Temporal stability does not imply tradability.**

Even if associations are stable across quarters, this does NOT mean:
- The score is predictive
- The score should be used for trading
- Any bucket threshold is meaningful

## Sample Overview

### Per-Quarter Sample Sizes

| Quarter | N | % of Total |
|---------|---|------------|
| Q1 2025 | [value] | [%] |
| Q2 2025 | [value] | [%] |
| Q3 2025 | [value] | [%] |
| Q4 2025 | [value] | [%] |
| **Total** | [value] | 100% |

### Minimum Sample Check

| Check | Threshold | Observed | Pass? |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Min quarterly N | ≥ 100 | [value] | [Y/N] |

## Per-Quarter Correlations

### Correlations by Quarter

| Quarter | N | r(fwd_ret_3) | r(mfe_3) | r(mae_3) |
|---------|---|--------------|----------|----------|
| Q1 2025 | | | | |
| Q2 2025 | | | | |
| Q3 2025 | | | | |
| Q4 2025 | | | | |
| **Full Sample** | | | | |

### Correlation Stability Metrics

| Outcome | Range (max-min) | Std | Sign Consistent? |
|---------|-----------------|-----|------------------|
| `fwd_ret_3` | [value] | [value] | [Yes/No] |
| `mfe_3` | [value] | [value] | [Yes/No] |
| `mae_3` | [value] | [value] | [Yes/No] |

**Interpretation:**
- Range < 0.1: Highly stable
- Range 0.1–0.2: Moderately stable
- Range > 0.2: Unstable
- Sign flip: Directionally inconsistent

## Tail Comparison by Quarter

### Top Decile vs Bottom Decile (fwd_ret_3)

| Quarter | Bottom (0-10) | Top (90-100) | Difference | Consistent? |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Q1 2025 | | | | |
| Q2 2025 | | | | |
| Q3 2025 | | | | |
| Q4 2025 | | | | |
| Full | | | | — |

**Consistent = same sign of difference as full sample**

## Delta Tables (Quarter vs Full-Sample)

### Correlation Deltas

| Quarter | Δr(fwd_ret_3) | Δr(mfe_3) | Δr(mae_3) |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Q1 | | | |
| Q2 | | | |
| Q3 | | | |
| Q4 | | | |

**Δ = quarterly correlation − full-sample correlation**
