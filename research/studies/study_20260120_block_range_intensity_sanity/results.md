# Study Results

> ⚠️ **NON-CANONICAL** — This study is downstream research only.  
> **NO FEEDBACK INTO CANONICAL** — Findings do not alter Option B/C definitions.

## ⚠️ NO OUTCOMES USED

**This results document contains NO analysis of Option C outcomes.**

There are no correlations with returns, MFE, MAE, or any forward-looking measure. This is purely a distributional analysis of the score itself.
