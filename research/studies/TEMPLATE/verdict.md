# Study Verdict

> ⚠️ **NON-CANONICAL** — This study is downstream research only.  
> **NO FEEDBACK INTO CANONICAL** — Findings do not alter Option B/C definitions.

## Hypothesis Outcome

| Hypothesis | Supported? | Confidence |
|------------|------------|------------|
| [Restate hypothesis from spec.md] | Yes / No / Partial | High / Medium / Low |

## Key Findings

### Finding 1

_[One-sentence summary of primary finding]_

**Evidence:** [Reference to specific result in results.md]

**Implication:** [What this means for understanding the data]

### Finding 2

_[One-sentence summary of secondary finding]_

**Evidence:** [Reference to specific result]

**Implication:** [What this means]

## Interpretation

_[2-3 paragraphs interpreting the results in context. What do these findings tell us about the canonical data? How do they relate to the research question?]_

## Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| [e.g., Limited time window] | [e.g., May not generalize] | [e.g., Future study with more data] |
| [e.g., Single instrument] | [e.g., Instrument-specific effects] | [e.g., Repeat for other pairs] |
| [e.g., No out-of-sample test] | [e.g., Overfitting risk] | [e.g., Hold-out validation] |

## Canonical Promotion Path (If Applicable)

_If findings suggest a new canonical metric or view, document the promotion path:_

| Step | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Draft RFC in `docs/` | Not started |
| 2 | Review with team | — |
| 3 | Implement in versioned release | — |

**Note:** Promotion requires explicit process; research artifacts do not automatically become canonical.
