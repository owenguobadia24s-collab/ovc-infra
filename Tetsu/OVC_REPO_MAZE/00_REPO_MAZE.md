# OVC Repo Maze (Curated)

This map is intentionally small and semantic. Use it as a navigation spine, not a mirror of the filesystem.

## How to navigate
- Start with an Option (A/D/B/C) to follow the pipeline lens.
- Jump to a Room to browse concrete artifacts (workflows/docs/sql/reports/artifacts).
- Each Option lists anchors and workflows, with inputs/outputs derived from actual files.

## Option spine
- [[OPT_A__CANONICAL_INGEST]]
- [[OPT_D__PATHS_BRIDGE]]
- [[OPT_B__DERIVED_LAYERS]]
- [[OPT_C__OUTCOMES_EVAL]]

## System canopy
- [[QA_GOVERNANCE]]

## Rooms
- [[ROOM__WORKFLOWS]]
- [[ROOM__DOCS]]
- [[ROOM__SQL]]
- [[ROOM__REPORTS]]
- [[ROOM__ARTIFACTS]]
