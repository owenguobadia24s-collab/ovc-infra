## Invariants Reminder

> **CRITICAL**: The following invariants apply to all observations in this run.

1. **Association ≠ Predictability**  
   Co-occurrence patterns observed between scores and outcomes do not imply
   that scores predict outcomes. Correlation is not causation.

2. **Scores Are Descriptive, Frozen**  
   Score definitions are locked at the versions specified above. They describe
   structural characteristics of price blocks. They are not signals.

3. **Observations Are Non-Interpretive**  
   All summaries in this report describe what occurred in the data. They do
   not prescribe actions, imply trading logic, or recommend thresholds.

## Verification Results

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| No Option B modifications | ✅ PASS |
| No score logic changes | ✅ PASS |
| Outputs are observational only | ✅ PASS |
| Frozen score versions used | ✅ PASS |
| Evidence views read-only | ✅ PASS |

---

## Governance Confirmation

- ✅ No Option B views, tables, or contracts were modified
- ✅ SCORE_LIBRARY_v1 unchanged (DIS-v1.1, RES-v1.0, LID-v1.0 remain frozen)
- ✅ No new scores added
- ✅ No interpretation layers added
- ✅ No automation escalation
- ✅ All outputs are observational summaries only
